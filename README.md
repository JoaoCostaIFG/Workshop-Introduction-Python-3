# Workshop: Introduction to Python 3

## Preface
This repository (including its wiki and github page) is mirror of the original (private) repository where the work/writting was done. I mirrored this repository, for archival and sharing purposes, the day after we taught this workshop.  
The authors (me included) are listen at the end of this file.

## Recommended IDEs
- [Spyder/Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/): Installs python and various modules for you, recommended for an easier setup.
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download): Requires the manual installation of the [most recent version of Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Please refer to [Python in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) for more detailed instructions. We recommend the Code Runner extension (present on the website listed above).
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/): [Vim8](https://vim8.org/) or [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) prefered. Only use if you are familiar with Vim. Recommended extensions: coc, coc-python (node.js required for both).
