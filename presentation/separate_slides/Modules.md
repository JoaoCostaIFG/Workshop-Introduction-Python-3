# Intro
Python's real power shines through the inumerous modules you can get online, ranging from better and faster math, statistics and machine learning.  
Here's a couple of modules we considere worth checking out:

## Interesing Modules

- **[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) & [ScyPy](https://www.scipy.org/)**: Use code written in C to boost computing speed and introduce computation with matrices and other mathematical data structures.
- **[MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/)**: Plot graphs, bar graphs, histograms and much more.
- **[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html)**: Statistical data visualization.
- **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)**: Process large ammounts of data from files and apply statistic methods to it.
- **[SciKit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)**: Regressions, machine learning and more.
- **[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)**: Machine learning, neural networks and deep learning.
