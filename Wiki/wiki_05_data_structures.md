# Data Structures


## Intro
Variables have already proven to be extremely useful in many situations but sometimes they are not enough. We'll now talk about Python's standard data structures and show how/why they can be useful in many situations.  

In Python, we have 4 standard data structures:  
1. [Lists](#lists)  
1. [Tuples](#tuples)  
1. [Sets](#sets)  
1. [Dictionaries](#dictionaries)
